# 🏏 IPL Analytics Dashboard - Power BI Project  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project is part of my internship with **Labmentix**.  
The objective was to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and build an interactive **Power BI Dashboard** using IPL data.  

The dashboard provides insights into:  
- Top batsmen & bowlers  
- Team performances across seasons  
- Toss impact on match results  
- Venue analysis  
- Season-wise trends

## 📊 Dataset  
The dataset was taken from Kaggle and cleaned for analysis.  

📂 Dataset files used:  
- [Deliveries Dataset](https://github.com/Ayush1824/IPL-Dashboard/blob/main/deliveries%20-%20deliveries.csv.csv)  
- [Matches Dataset](https://github.com/Ayush1824/IPL-Dashboard/blob/main/matches%20(1)%20-%20matches%20(1).csv%20(1).csv)  

After cleaning & transformation, a final dataset `cleaned_IPL.csv` was created for Power BI analysis.
